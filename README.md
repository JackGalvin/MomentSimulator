# MomentSimulator
Stuff that isn't working in this build:
None of the VBOX with all the momentInformation in it is showing
All of the currentSimulation functions and variables have been forced to be static (global)
Originally only plankLength and PivotPosition were the only things with the static prefix
New Name of package so need to update json files
Made json under git ignore to not replace code needed for each individual device
